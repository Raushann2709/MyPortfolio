## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or newer)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
* A MongoDB Atlas cluster (or a local MongoDB instance)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```env
# MongoDB connection string
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-atlas-connection-string>

# Server port (optional; defaults to 5000)
PORT=5000
```

> **Note:** Never commit your `.env` file to GitHub. Add it to your `.gitignore`:
>
> ```gitignore
> node_modules/
> .env
> ```

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.
